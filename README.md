# Weak-Password-Predictor
Final Project for CSCI375 AI for Cybersecurity

Upon running `model.ipynb`, the program takes a user-inputted password and evaluates its strength/weakness.
There are five categories that a password can fall under:
- Very Weak
- Weak
- Average
- Strong
- Very Strong

The program has been trained using `.csv` files containing passwords with a strength level ranging from 0 to 4.
